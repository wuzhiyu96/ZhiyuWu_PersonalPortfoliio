#About Me and Initial Learning Goals
## Introduction

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Environmental Sciences at Wageningen University. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Atmospheric Sciences, where I gained a solid foundation in meteorology, air quality, and remote sensing, as well as proficiency in data analysis tools such as MATLAB, Fortran, and C. During my Master's program, I have focused on air pollution research and geo-information. While during my master, I have extensively used Python for course projects and my master's thesis, my learning has been self-directed rather than systematic. I have completed several courses on ArcGIS Pro and feel reasonably confident in applying it effectively in my work. However, I have yet to use these skills in a realistic, real-world project.

Although I have gained experience with data analysis tools, my knowledge is not yet systematic, and I lack hands-on experience applying these skills in real-world projects. I aim to build expertise in using these tools more effectively and responsibly for environmental research.

I enrolled in this course because I recognize the critical importance of data analysis expertise for my future career as an environmental scientist. My goal is to learn how to manage data efficiently and responsibly, enhance my proficiency with data analysis software, and gain valuable experience by collaborating with others on a practical, real-world project.

## List of Personal Learning Goals

### Goal 1: Information analysis and visualization
**"To use Python and data-analysis-related Python library in a professional set-up."**

While I have used Python extensively in various courses and my master thesis to organize data and create visualizations, my knowledge remains somewhat unstructured because I learned it informally through online resources and by troubleshooting specific issues. As a result, I sometimes lack confidence in understanding certain code blocks. To address this, by Week 2 of the course, I aim to share scripts with clear, well-documented annotations to facilitate collaboration within the group. By the end of the course, I intend to fully understand and confidently explain all Python code used in our project, demonstrating a clear grasp of its functionality and purpose. This structured approach will help solidify my Python skills and enhance my ability to contribute effectively in a professional environment.

### Goal 2: Data acquisition
**"Learn how to use Arcgis Pro in a realistic case study situation."**

I have completed two courses on ArcGIS Pro, which have made me quite familiar with its interface, allowing me to resolve geo-location related tasks and utilize repetitive functions through the toolboxes. While these courses introduced the basics of finding data online and using it within the software, most of the datasets were pre-prepared. My goal is to systematically learn how to acquire and apply data from online sources in a realistic case study scenario. To achieve this, I aim to acquire all the essential data and present it clearly in ArcGIS Pro by the end of Week 2. By the end of the project, I want to be able to collaborate with my team to create ArcGIS StoryMaps using the data collected online.

### Goal 3: Cooperation and data sharing within the group
**"How to record your contribution and organize your work within a group set-up"**

In my previous Master's courses, group work has always been an essential component. While some group projects produced excellent results, others were poorly implemented. A common issue was the lack of documentation regarding how tasks were carried out within the group, and opportunities for reflection during the process were rare. In this course, I aim to develop effective teamwork skills, particularly in sharing data and python scripts in an organized and understandable way. To achieve this, I will begin maintaining a personal work log starting in Week 2, where I will reflect on my daily contributions and progress. I will also ensure that important documents and scripts are consistently uploaded to the group repository with sufficient annotations to make them accessible and clear to all members. Furthermore, our group will hold weekly reflection meetings to review progress, identify areas for improvement, and set actionable goals for the following week. 

### Goal 4: Social and privacy aspects
**"For this project and future career, what should be done to be responsible of your data?"**

Since I come from a scientific background and completed my Bachelor's degree in another country, the topics of data privacy and conducting research ethically are relatively new to me. While I have read some articles about these issues in my personal time, I have not yet applied them in an academic setting. Additionally, I am curious about potential underlying issues associated with using public data, which often seems prevalent and harmless at first glance. To gain a deeper understanding of these topics, I will begin by reading at least three academic articles on data privacy and ethical research practices. I will document the main arguments from these articles and reflect on how they relate to this project and my future career. In Week 3, I will contribute to our group's poster presentation on the social and ethical aspects of the project. Through these efforts, I aim to develop a strong sense of responsibility for managing data ethically and to consistently consider social and ethical issues for my future professional endeavors.
