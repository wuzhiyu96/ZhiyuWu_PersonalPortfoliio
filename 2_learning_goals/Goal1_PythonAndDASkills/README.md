# Goal 1: Information Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This folder contains materials related to the first learning goal, jupyter notebooks containing codes I wrote for the course are included in /Notebooks, input data and output data are stored in /Data. In both folders, there are separate README.md describing detailed information about the notebooks.

## Background
### My Python Journey Before This Course
- Previous experience with Python in courses and master thesis
- Self-taught through online resources and troubleshooting
- Informal learning led to lack of confidence in understanding code blocks
- Desire to develop structured and professional Python skills
  
### The Traffic Project
For our project, I am responsible for analysing $NO_x$ measurement data and regression on the emission factor.
 
### The Internship Project (TBC)

## Methodology
### Data Sources
- RIVM datasets related to pollution

### Approach
- Systematic learning of Python libraries
- Focus on code documentation and annotation
- Collaborative code review
- Structured skill development

## Implementation
- Documented all Python scripts with clear annotations
- Broke down complex code blocks for better understanding
- Practiced explaining code functionality to team members, specifically other people working on the pollution part.
- Update codes with our teammates on Teams channel everyday
- Focused on libraries by doing notebooks provided by lecturers
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
  - NumPy for numerical computing

## Results
Described in the notebooks.

## Conclusions
Through this course, I significantly enhanced my data analysis skills and collaborative capabilities. I learned to write clear, shareable Python code that can be easily run on different computers, and developed a much deeper understanding of various Python libraries, this new knowledge also helped me to improve some figures for my internship report (will include them if I have extra time). GitHub became a valuable tool for me, not just for project collaboration, but also for improving and sharing my work for the personal portfolio. The experience has substantially boosted my confidence in Python programming and my ability to work effectively in team-based data science projects.
