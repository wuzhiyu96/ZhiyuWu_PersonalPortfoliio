# Goal 1: Information Analysis and Visualization

## Background
### My Python Journey Before the course
- Previous experience with Python in courses and master thesis
- Self-taught through online resources and troubleshooting
- Informal learning led to lack of confidence in understanding code blocks
- Desire to develop structured and professional Python skills
### The Traffic Project
### The Internship Project

## Methodology
### Data Sources
- Course-related datasets
- Project-specific data
- Online open-source datasets

### Approach
