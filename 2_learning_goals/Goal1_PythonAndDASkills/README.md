# Goal 1: Information Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This folder contains materials related to the first learning goal, jupyter notebooks containing codes I wrote for the course are included in /Notebooks, input data and output data are stored in /Data. In both folders, there are separate README.md describing detailed information about the notebooks.

## Background
### My Python Journey Before This Course
- Previous experience with Python in courses and master thesis
- Self-taught through online resources and troubleshooting
- Informal learning led to lack of confidence in understanding code blocks
- Desire to develop structured and professional Python skills
  
### The Traffic Project
For our project, I am responsible for analysing $NO_x$ measurement data and regression on the emission factor.
 
### The Internship Project (TBC)

## Methodology
### Data Sources
- RIVM datasets related to pollution

### Approach
- Systematic learning of Python libraries
- Focus on code documentation and annotation
- Collaborative code review
- Structured skill development

## Implementation
- Documented all Python scripts with clear annotations
- Broke down complex code blocks for better understanding
- Practiced explaining code functionality to team members, specifically other people working on the pollution part.
- Update codes with our teammates on Teams channel everyday
- Focused on libraries by doing notebooks provided by lecturers
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
  - NumPy for numerical computing

## Results
Described in the notebooks.

## Conclusions
After this course, I learnt how to work with other people on data analysis project, how to make codes that are possible to exchange with other people and run on another computer. I also have much better understanding of various libraries in Python. It not only helped with the group project, but also helped me to improve some figures I made for my internship report (will include if I have extra time). I feel much confident about my Python skills.
