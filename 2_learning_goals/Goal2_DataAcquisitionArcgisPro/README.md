# Goal 2: Data acquisition and web map publishing
## Overview
## Background
I have previously completed two courses on ArcGIS Pro, which provided me with:
- Familiarity with the software interface
- Ability to resolve geo-location related tasks
- Understanding of basic toolbox functions

However, my previous experience was limited by:
- Pre-prepared datasets
- Lack of real-world data acquisition skills
- Minimal experience in independent data sourcing

For this project, I am planning to map out $NO_x$ measurement stations' relative location with the highway, as a way to select suitable locations for our research.

## Methodology and Data Sources
### Data Acquisition Approach
I approached data collection systematically, focusing on reliable and accessible sources. For pollution measurement data, I used the familiar RIVM website, which provided a straightforward download process. The highway data required more effort due to language barriers, but I successfully located the information on the Rijkswaterstaat website.

### Data Verification
To ensure data reliability, I employed multiple verification strategies. For the highway shapefile, I cross-referenced the data with alternative sources and Google Maps to confirm its accuracy and completeness.

### Data Sources
- RIVM (Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment)
- Rijkswaterstaat

## Implementation Details
The project utilized two primary data sources:
- $NO_x$ pollution data and location calculations from previous work (File can be find in 
- Highway geo-locations in polyline format, downloaded from official sources

The implementation process is documented through ArcGIS Toolbox screenshots, demonstrating the step-by-step data processing approach.

## Results
The project culminated in a published web map, showcasing the integrated NO_x pollution and highway location data.
