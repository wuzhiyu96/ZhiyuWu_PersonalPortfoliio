# Goal 2: Data acquisition and web map publishing
## Background
I have previously completed two courses on ArcGIS Pro, which provided me with:
- Familiarity with the software interface
- Ability to resolve geo-location related tasks
- Understanding of basic toolbox functions

However, my previous experience was limited by:
- Pre-prepared datasets
- Lack of real-world data acquisition skills
- Minimal experience in independent data sourcing

## Methodology and Data Sources
### Data Acquisition Approach
- Identify reliable online data sources
- Use government and research institution databases
- Verify data quality and relevance
- Cross-reference multiple sources

### Data Sources
- RIVM (Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment)
- Governmental open data platforms
- Scientific research databases
- Geospatial data repositories

## Implementation Details
- Systematic data collection process
- Careful evaluation of data relevance
- Integration of diverse data types
- Practical application in project context

### Key Implementation Steps
- Locate appropriate online data sources
- Download and process geospatial data
- Clean and prepare datasets
- Integrate data into ArcGIS Pro
- Create meaningful visualizations

## Results
- Successfully acquired multiple datasets
- Developed skills in independent data sourcing
- Created comprehensive geospatial visualizations
- Produced ArcGIS StoryMaps with collected data

## Conclusions
