# Goal 3: Cooperation and Data Sharing within the Group
## Overview
In this document, I will include the main learning results of this goal, which include:
- A brief introduction of collaborative methodologies, including the application in our project
- A document about our group's data-sharing strategies
- A critical reflection on the group project's management, what went well and what can be improved

## Background
In my previous Master's courses, group work experiences varied significantly. I encountered these challenges through my program:
- Lack of systematic documentation
- Minimal opportunities for process reflection
- Inconsistent task tracking and contribution recording

This goal aimed to develop more effective teamwork skills, focusing on organized data and script sharing, and implementing structured collaboration methods.

## Methodology and Collaborative Approach
### Teamwork Strategies
- Personal log of daily work
- Organize daily group reflection meetings, and maintain good data-sharing behaviours
- Consistent documentation (todo list for tomorrow at the end of the day)
- Agile-inspired project management techniques

### Tools and Platforms
- Teams channel for code and document sharing
- Regular communication channels: Whatsapp 
- Collaborative documentation practices: Onedrive and Arcgis Storymaps

## Results

## Conclusions and reflection
By learning about Agile project management tools, I discovered how good communication and clear record-keeping can really help group work. Even though our short project didn't show big changes, the lessons were still important for future teamwork.

These tools showed me how tracking progress and sharing information can make working together easier and more effective. The skills I learned will be useful in future group projects, even if we couldn't use them fully this time.
