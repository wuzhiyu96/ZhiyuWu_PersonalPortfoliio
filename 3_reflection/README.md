#### Knowledge Integration
#### Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Knowledge Integration

Our project demonstrated the power of collaborative research across different academic disciplines. Considering our expertise, we approached our research on Dutch highway speed limits with a multifaceted perspective.

Throughout the project, we actively identified and addressed knowledge gaps. We recognized that our team might lack expertise and time in advanced traffic modeling and comprehensive air quality simulations. We sought additional insights from other research groups and lectures, and decided to focus mainly on visualize highway traffic in time-series manner and national map, as well as using pollution measurement data and emission calculation.

We engaged with Group Traffic 2 and other teams, creating a knowledge exchange network. This approach allowed us to compensate for individual knowledge gaps and develop a more robust research methodology.

Personal learning goals played a crucial role in our project. Each team member aimed to develop specific skills, share expertise, and contribute meaningfully to the research. By aligning individual objectives with team goals, we created a dynamic and supportive research environment.

The project ultimately demonstrated how interdisciplinary collaboration can transform individual limitations into collective strengths, producing a comprehensive and nuanced research outcome.

## Aspects of Learning

### Successful Elements
#### Skills and Approaches That Worked Well
The project introduced me to new technologies and approaches, including ArcGIS StoryMaps and GitHub, which expanded my technical toolkit. These tools not only enhanced my project capabilities but also prompted deeper reflection on research ethics. The lecturers' materials on machine learning, visualization, and data wrangling provided valuable insights into data science within environmental sciences, offering a broader perspective on research methodologies.

#### Positive Learning Experiences
The combination of lectures and group work created an ideal environment for applying newly acquired skills. Carefully following class instructions became more meaningful as theoretical knowledge transformed into practical application. The ethics workshop was particularly enlightening, offering an opportunity to brainstorm with other groups and explore diverse perspectives. This experience taught me the importance of listening without prejudice, recognizing that even within an academic setting, viewpoints can vary significantly.

#### Moments of Significant Personal Development
Initially, the project seemed overwhelming and ambiguous. However, with support from lecturers and collaborative brainstorming with fellow students, the path forward became increasingly clear. This process significantly boosted my confidence and improved my ability to handle academic pressure. Time management skills also saw substantial improvement through daily stand-up meetings and consistent communication with group mates and other student groups. These interactions provided clarity about project steps, potential challenges, and realistic time frames.

#### Effective Strategies Implemented
Maintaining a daily reflection log and creating a shared progress folder within the group proved instrumental in tracking our collective and individual development. Weekly presentations and brainstorming sessions with other groups and the lecturer provided valuable external perspectives and continuous feedback, enhancing our project's overall quality and approach.


### Challenges and Limitations
- Difficulties encountered during the project
- Areas of struggle or uncertainty
- Obstacles in skill development
- Lessons learned from setbacks

## Project Outcomes and Potential Applications
Our research provides valuable evidence regarding the effectiveness of speed limit changes on Dutch highways, offering a comprehensive foundation for future scientific investigations. By presenting a detailed analysis, we create an accessible starting point for researchers interested in expanding this critical area of study.

The project's outcomes extend beyond academic research, presenting practical implications for policy development. Our findings and visualizations can serve as powerful communication tools for stakeholders, including government officials, transportation planners, and environmental policymakers. By generating clear, visually compelling representations of our research, we enable more effective communication of complex environmental and transportation data. These visualizations can help translate technical findings into understandable information, facilitating broader public and professional discourse on the impacts of transportation policy changes.
